TippedTheScale
===============

Provide a question, two images, and get a shareable link where people can pick one image or the other. Use the results as a data point to help tip the scale of your indecision. Results can be hidden for a specified duration. Built in one night with CodeIgniter + Twitter Bootstrap.

This was written in a few hours, just because.
